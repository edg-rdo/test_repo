Howdy,

Here's how Python and R interact.

```{r}
print("here we go")
#here is a regular R markdown chunk
eh <- "ok"
```

```{R}
# R CHUNK
library(reticulate)
```

```{python}
#PYTHON CHUNK
x = "yes"
print(r.eh,x)

```

```{R}
#R CHUNK
cat(c(eh,py$x))

```

```{python}
#python
import numpy as np
matx=np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
```
```{R}
# r
maty<-solve(py$matx)
maty
```

```{python}
#python
np.dot(matx,r.maty).round()
```

### Here are python examples from the second to last homework in a python chunk
```{python}

import pandas as pd
quakes=pd.read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/quakes.csv",index_col=0)

quakes.shape
#There are 1000 observations of each variable, and there are 5 variables in total.
np.median(quakes[quakes.long>175].mag)
#the median magnitude for quakes whose longitude is greater than 175. 

np.median(quakes.depth)
np.std(quakes[quakes.depth>247].lat,ddof=1)
np.std(quakes[quakes.depth<247].lat,ddof=1)

```
The standard deviation of the variable lat when depth is greater than the median depth is 3.577252 and the standard deviation of the variable lat when depth is less than the median depth is 6.1501. This suggests that earthquakes at lower depths vary much more in latitudinal coordinates.

###Here's a pic of a wooden van I decked out in Forza:
